**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_REST API design_**
  - One of my problems when starting to program is to grasp the nuances of a langugae's syntax and promptly code away without really understanding the conceptual foundation. So, in my efforts to learn JavaScript and enter the web development paradigm, I ventured into REST API design. I toiled away at researching so many definitions to understand RESTful practices and phrases such as "architectural design" confounded more. However, backtracking to what I know about HTTP methodologies and communicatinig with external APIs, I was then able to acknowledge the need for RESTful practices. Without some type of uniform approach to designing APIs, so many different formats would run amuck and communication between APIs would be extremely inefficient. The biggest takeaway from learning REST API design is that it's okay to reserve some time to understand the conceptual aspects of a topic 🙇🏽‍♂️ (even if it's cumbersome 😭 before coding 🖥
