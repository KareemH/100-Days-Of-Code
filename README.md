# 100-Days-Of-Code

### Day 1: June 2, 2020

**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_REST API design_**
  - One of my problems when starting to program was grasping the nuances of a langugae's syntax, which only complicated my learning process. Thus, I began to code promptly without really understanding the conceptual foundation of what I was learning. So, in my efforts to learn JavaScript and enter the web development paradigm, I ventured into REST API design. I toiled away at researching so many definitions to understand RESTful practices and phrases such as "architectural design" did not bring much clarity. However, backtracking to what I know about HTTP methodologies and communicatinig with external APIs, I was then able to acknowledge the need for RESTful practices: without some type of uniform approach to designing APIs, so many different formats would run amuck and communication between APIs would be extremely inefficient. Slowly establishinig those connections and coming to my own (non-pedantic) analysis, I learned that it's okay to reserve some time to understand the conceptual aspects of a topic üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (even if it's cumbersome üò≠) before trying to code üñ•
- **_Re-learninig Node.js_**
  - Although I already have an understanding of the Node.js workflow, I still had a desire to explore "behind the scenes" mechanisms. Instructors and tutorials provided such abstract overviews of things like the `module` object, so I was just coding along passively instead of actively. Through much research, I was able to extend my knowledge of Node.js conceptually, helping me to intuitively code (asking myself why I was using a certain module, why is the syntax structured like this, etc.) instead of looking back at documentation/examples every 5 minutes üòÖ

### Day 2: June 4, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Watching Coding Related Career Videos_**
  - Sometimes the people I meet in real life don't provide really valuable informatioon regarding the tech industry. Now, what's considered "valuable" may vary from person to person, but I receive geninue advice really well and deflect cliche advice when I detect it. Thankfully, there's a really helpful Youtube community of coders that discuss really interesting matters in the tech community. They also clarify a lot of nuances in tech that I've always reflected on. For instance, although some may disagree, I agreed with this one Youtuber who claimed there is a subtle (yet significant difference) between Software Engineer and Software Developer, and this is immensely helpful when figuring out your career path. The way how certain mentors, advisors, and advertisements gloss every career path as "software developer" makes you wonder if there are any data scientists left üòÇ. Ultimately, I just binged these types of videos all day. But I find it amazing that there's this open source community of people sharing insights and debunking popular myths on the tech world - all for free. Imagine the developers in 2005 having Aim as their most popular option of information exchange üò©

### Day 3: June 5, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Authentication and Security_**
  - It was really interesting to see the layered approaches of authentication, from simple usernames and passwords, encrypting passwords, environment variables, hashing passwords, hacking (for learning purposes!), salting, etc.
- **_Passport.js_**
  - Learned about cookies and sessions, Passport.js middleware functionality. It's great to have all this encapsulation of code being handled by Passport, while I focus on my web app at hand. Although, Passport.js does a really good job of abstracting the low level details (which I am thankful for), sometimes I feel as if certain middleware abstracts to the point where I don't feel like I did anything because all of the hard work and real mechanisms is delegated to other libraries. I don't know, it's just a thought. But I can't complain üòÅ

### Day 4: June 6, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Passport.js and OAuth 2.0_**
  - OAuth was a beast in its own, so I had to extend my authentication learning for another day. OAuth was actually very interesting to implement, and the amount of strategies a developer can utilize really showcases Passport's flexibility. I only worked with Google OAuth which was fairly simple. There were some deprecation errors, so that meant a lot of researching to address these errors. I may want to explore OAuth for Spotify or Twitter third party authentication

### Day 5: June 7, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Passport.js Mini Project Using Local Strategy_**
  - [Working Repository](https://github.com/KareemH/NodeJS-Express-Passport-Practice)

### Day 6: June 9, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - In my quest to actively understand instead of passively learn, I have decided t re-learn JavaScript from the ground up. Fundamentals include values and variables, primitive data types, JavaScript quirks, etc. Most notably, I investigated more on the JS Console, intepreted vs compiled languages, and Chrome's V8 Engine (which hints at Node.js!). Today seemed like grunt work at first, but fundamentals are very important before advancing forwards. Learning is very cumulative, so I try not to undermine what I learn as it may rear its ugly head later on
