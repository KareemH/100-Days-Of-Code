# 100-Days-Of-Code

### Day 1: June 2, 2020

**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_REST API design_**
  - One of my problems when starting to program was grasping the nuances of a langugae's syntax, which only complicated my learning process. Thus, I began to code promptly without really understanding the conceptual foundation of what I was learning. So, in my efforts to learn JavaScript and enter the web development paradigm, I ventured into REST API design. I toiled away at researching so many definitions to understand RESTful practices and phrases such as "architectural design" did not bring much clarity. However, backtracking to what I know about HTTP methodologies and communicatinig with external APIs, I was then able to acknowledge the need for RESTful practices: without some type of uniform approach to designing APIs, so many different formats would run amuck and communication between APIs would be extremely inefficient. Slowly establishinig those connections and coming to my own (non-pedantic) analysis, I learned that it's okay to reserve some time to understand the conceptual aspects of a topic üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (even if it's cumbersome üò≠) before trying to code üñ•
- **_Re-learninig Node.js_**
  - Although I already have an understanding of the Node.js workflow, I still had a desire to explore "behind the scenes" mechanisms. Instructors and tutorials provided such abstract overviews of things like the `module` object, so I was just coding along passively instead of actively. Through much research, I was able to extend my knowledge of Node.js conceptually, helping me to intuitively code (asking myself why I was using a certain module, why is the syntax structured like this, etc.) instead of looking back at documentation/examples every 5 minutes üòÖ
