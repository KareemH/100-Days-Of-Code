# 100-Days-Of-Code

### Day 1: June 2, 2020

**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_REST API design_**
  - One of my problems when starting to program was grasping the nuances of a langugae's syntax, which only complicated my learning process. Thus, I began to code promptly without really understanding the conceptual foundation of what I was learning. So, in my efforts to learn JavaScript and enter the web development paradigm, I ventured into REST API design. I toiled away at researching so many definitions to understand RESTful practices and phrases such as "architectural design" did not bring much clarity. However, backtracking to what I know about HTTP methodologies and communicatinig with external APIs, I was then able to acknowledge the need for RESTful practices: without some type of uniform approach to designing APIs, so many different formats would run amuck and communication between APIs would be extremely inefficient. Slowly establishinig those connections and coming to my own (non-pedantic) analysis, I learned that it's okay to reserve some time to understand the conceptual aspects of a topic üôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (even if it's cumbersome üò≠) before trying to code üñ•
- **_Re-learninig Node.js_**
  - Although I already have an understanding of the Node.js workflow, I still had a desire to explore "behind the scenes" mechanisms. Instructors and tutorials provided such abstract overviews of things like the `module` object, so I was just coding along passively instead of actively. Through much research, I was able to extend my knowledge of Node.js conceptually, helping me to intuitively code (asking myself why I was using a certain module, why is the syntax structured like this, etc.) instead of looking back at documentation/examples every 5 minutes üòÖ

### Day 2: June 4, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Watching Coding Related Career Videos_**
  - Sometimes the people I meet in real life don't provide really valuable informatioon regarding the tech industry. Now, what's considered "valuable" may vary from person to person, but I receive geninue advice really well and deflect cliche advice when I detect it. Thankfully, there's a really helpful Youtube community of coders that discuss really interesting matters in the tech community. They also clarify a lot of nuances in tech that I've always reflected on. For instance, although some may disagree, I agreed with this one Youtuber who claimed there is a subtle (yet significant difference) between Software Engineer and Software Developer, and this is immensely helpful when figuring out your career path. The way how certain mentors, advisors, and advertisements gloss every career path as "software developer" makes you wonder if there are any data scientists left üòÇ. Ultimately, I just binged these types of videos all day. But I find it amazing that there's this open source community of people sharing insights and debunking popular myths on the tech world - all for free. Imagine the developers in 2005 having Aim as their most popular option of information exchange üò©

### Day 3: June 5, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Authentication and Security_**
  - It was really interesting to see the layered approaches of authentication, from simple usernames and passwords, encrypting passwords, environment variables, hashing passwords, hacking (for learning purposes!), salting, etc.
- **_Passport.js_**
  - Learned about cookies and sessions, Passport.js middleware functionality. It's great to have all this encapsulation of code being handled by Passport, while I focus on my web app at hand. Although, Passport.js does a really good job of abstracting the low level details (which I am thankful for), sometimes I feel as if certain middleware abstracts to the point where I don't feel like I did anything because all of the hard work and real mechanisms is delegated to other libraries. I don't know, it's just a thought. But I can't complain üòÅ

### Day 4: June 6, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Passport.js and OAuth 2.0_**
  - OAuth was a beast in its own, so I had to extend my authentication learning for another day. OAuth was actually very interesting to implement, and the amount of strategies a developer can utilize really showcases Passport's flexibility. I only worked with Google OAuth which was fairly simple. There were some deprecation errors, so that meant a lot of researching to address these errors. I may want to explore OAuth for Spotify or Twitter third party authentication

### Day 5: June 7, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Passport.js Mini Project Using Local Strategy_**
  - [Working Repository](https://github.com/KareemH/NodeJS-Express-Passport-Practice)

### Day 6: June 9, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - In my quest to actively understand instead of passively learn, I have decided t re-learn JavaScript from the ground up. Fundamentals include values and variables, primitive data types, JavaScript quirks, etc. Most notably, I investigated more on the JS Console, intepreted vs compiled languages, and Chrome's V8 Engine (which hints at Node.js!). Today seemed like grunt work at first, but fundamentals are very important before advancing forwards. Learning is very cumulative, so I try not to undermine what I learn as it may rear its ugly head later on 

### Day 7: June 10, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - Still some preliminary learning around comparison operators, conditional statments, logical operators, operator precedence, switch statements, ternary operators, arrays and reference types, objects (accessing through dot and bracket notation, nested arrays and objects, and array/object equality (previous knowledge on hardware and RAM guided my understanding of reference types)
  
### Day 8: June 11, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - Exposed to different types of loops besides for and while loops and the implications of using for...of/for...in vs for/while loops when dealing with arrays and object properties (which are not explicitly iterable)
  - Looking at several examples of how one may refactor her/his code really helps to be familiar with what I might see in the wild...

### Day 9: June 12, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - Learned about the different types of scope including function scope, block scope, and lexical scope
  - Finally cleared up some misconceptions about callbacks. I knew how to use callback functions, but I never understood the underlying reason how and why they're implemented as a feature of JavaScript
  - Hoisting was a new concept for me
  - Practiced in using callback functions with popular array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

### Day 10: June 13, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - Learned new JavaScript features such as rest parameters, array/object de-structuring, etc. I've seen these features in other people's code in the past and never really understood the underlying syntax. So, I think it was a good idea to re-learn JavaScript from the ground up as a lot of gaps are being filled

### Day 11: June 14, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - The `this` method is most likely the main reason why I wanted to start over with my understanding of JavaScript. I gained a more clear grasp on execution scope and invocation context, allowing me to decide on best use cases of `this` in my code
  - Refresher on the DOM and discerned between the window and document object (which confuses which is really the "global" object)

### Day 12: June 15, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - Learned about DOM manipulation without jQuery. Although I like jQuery, it encapsulates too much detail about how the DOM is traversed, so I needed to practice this topic with vanilla JavaScript
  - Learned about basic selection methods

### Day 13: June 16, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - Continued learning about the DOM, especially updating inline styles. Really interesting to see how a style object overwrites a stylesheet
  - Manipulating classes
  - Creating elements and inserting based on an element's relationship with other nodes in the DOM
  - Adding event listeners: [Chasing wealth game](https://codepen.io/Kareem41/pen/OJMpXRY)

### Day 14: June 17, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - Demystified the asynchronous concepts of JS. This was a more conceptual study session rather than actual coding, but it was still very much essential. I could finally see the need for callbacks (which should be call-after, in my opinion) in asynchronous programming. [Helpful demo I found online](http://latentflip.com/loupe/?code=JC5vbignYnV0dG9uJywgJ2NsaWNrJywgZnVuY3Rpb24gb25DbGljaygpIHsKICAgIHNldFRpbWVvdXQoZnVuY3Rpb24gdGltZXIoKSB7CiAgICAgICAgY29uc29sZS5sb2coJ1lvdSBjbGlja2VkIHRoZSBidXR0b24hJyk7ICAgIAogICAgfSwgMjAwMCk7Cn0pOwoKY29uc29sZS5sb2coIkhpISIpOwoKc2V0VGltZW91dChmdW5jdGlvbiB0aW1lb3V0KCkgewogICAgY29uc29sZS5sb2coIkNsaWNrIHRoZSBidXR0b24hIik7Cn0sIDUwMDApOwoKY29uc29sZS5sb2coIldlbGNvbWUgdG8gbG91cGUuIik7!!!PGJ1dHRvbj5DbGljayBtZSE8L2J1dHRvbj4%3D)
  - I have worked with Promises before, but I never understood the syntax or need for them. I finally clarified my understanding of the resolve and reject methods, investigated on Promise status, `.then()` and `.catch()` chaining methods, etc.

### Day 15: June 18, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - When I was first introduced to HTTP, I was immediately introduced to the client-friendly `axios`. However, I wanted to know what actually led up to a light-weight library like `axios`, so I decided to backtrack to AJAX and XML to understand the evolution of making HTTP requests. I researched how developers transitioned from XMLHttpRequest to Fetch to Axios and many other HTTP client libraries. With JSON being so omnipresent, shouldn't AJAX be renamed to AJAJ ü§î
  - Moved onto async/await, the syntactical sugar for Promises. I haved used async/await before in a project, but with a rudimentary understanding of what goes on behind the scenes (which led to a lot of unecessary bugs). I find async/await a friendly alternative that gives off a pseudo-synchronous behavior (which is great for me considering I came from a C++ background of sequential execution)

### Day 16: June 19, 2020
**Topics Learned Today:**
- **_Re-learninig JavaScript_**
  - I never understood the purpose of `__proto__` in objects whenever I performed `console.log`.So, I had to research the concept of a "prototype," which resembles the features of inheritance in C++. However, I realize `__proto__` does much more in allowing multiple objects point to the same type, allowing objects to point to and share common methods rather than save their own copy which wastes memory space.
  - Had to distinguish `.prototype` vs `__proto__`
  - Learned about JavaScript's take on OOP. I researched how classes arose from the inconvenience of factory functions and plain constructors. Also, I familiarized myself with `extends` and `super`, which I have seen in React (pre-hooks) many times
